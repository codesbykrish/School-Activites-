WORM is a game where you play as a worm and you try to collect as many leaves as possible before you die.
I made this game for a school final assignment
When you load the game, you will see a grass-like background and a play button.
Clicking the play button will allow you to play the game.
You will see a gray dot and a green dot. The gray dot will be the worm and the green dot will be the leaf. 
Press the arrow keys to move worm and it will move in the direction you choose and keep going until you press another button
Use the arrow keys and move the worm to collect as many leaves as you can
The more leaves you eat, the long you grow
The worm has three lifes so if the worm hits themself or the edge of the screen, you spawn back to where you originally started, and you starting as a gray dot again
When you lose all your lifes, you are met with a game over screen and a high score
